This data is relevant because psychology is a growing field because it’s a way of teaching practical wisdom to normal, unique, or non-conforming individuals. Psychology tries to rationalize the complex thoughts of the human brain and explain phenomena through rational experiences. Thinking widely the value of the dollar and previous collapse economies have affected the pay for individual and is always fluctuating also to mention inflation. Getting an average range for base pay entering a job out of college is also important in our community being a college town. Power around the world is determined by money instead of values and morals. The population is based on psychologist using their degree out of college and reports estimated earning and comparing age and states can highlight better places to work.
